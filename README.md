# Pawan Putra Business OS

Business operating system (CRM and operations) for a multi-service company with exactly six
business verticals:

1. CCTV & Security
2. Digital Marketing
3. Interior Design
4. Architecture & Tech
5. Solar
6. IT Support

This repository currently contains the **platform foundation**: architecture, conventions, tooling and
the database foundation (organizations, branches, users, roles, permissions and the service catalog),
authentication with role/permission-based authorization, the organization and configuration
module (branches and the service catalog, with admin screens), automatic audit and activity logging,
and customer management. Leads, quotations, projects, invoicing and the other CRM modules are not built yet.

| Backend | Java 21, Spring Boot 4, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA (Hibernate), Bean Validation, Flyway, Spring Scheduler, Actuator, springdoc OpenAPI |
| Data | PostgreSQL (source of truth), Redis (cache), MinIO / S3-compatible object storage |
| Infrastructure | Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx |
| Testing | JUnit 5, Mockito, ArchUnit, Testcontainers, REST Assured, Playwright, k6 |

## Quick start

Prerequisites: JDK 21+, Node 22+, Docker.

```bash
cp .env.example .env            # local credentials for the containers
docker compose up -d            # PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO

cd backend && ./mvnw spring-boot:run     # API on http://localhost:8080
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev # UI on http://localhost:5173
```

- UI: <http://localhost:5173> (sign in with the local admin from `backend/src/main/resources/application-local.yml`)
- API docs (local profile only): <http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html>
- Health: <http://localhost:8080/actuator/health>

To run everything in containers behind Nginx instead: `docker compose --profile app up -d --build`,
then open <http://localhost:8088>.
